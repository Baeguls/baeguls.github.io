  <h1>One Day in August</h1>
<p>
I remember walking down Waverley Place past Washington Square Park during my freshman year, sometime around my birthday, fantasizing about meeting up with all the birthday versions of Sean. What is 12 up to? Is he really happier than the rest? Does 30 own a home?  
</p>
  
<p>
Well, 18 on the cusp of 19 went back to his dorm with clothes strewn all over the desk and papers strewn all over the floor and sucked on a Geek Bar about two dozen times while rereading that wine menu dressed like it was his wedding for that restaurant interview. The gay manager’s eye could not stop twitching at the NYU kid in a suit who wanted to wait tables at a steakhouse. While Dhruv typed away on his laptop and Ryan slept.

I think that time in my life was really quite miserable. We drank every Friday and Saturday like our lives depended on it, most Thursdays too, that one Monday with Alex in a bar I couldn’t afford. Always going to Warehouse Wine and Spirits with $20 or $30 I didn’t have from my Dad’s credit card to get Soju for $6 or Voda for $16 or 4 seltzers for $10 when we had to drink through sickness. Always starting in some dorm and ending in some dorm, going who knows where in between.

And the weed, too. All those walks with Alex to go buy weed from smoke shops. We always got it on the third or fourth try. Somehow, there was always money to spend $60 or $100 on a new cart. We would hit it on the subway platform and in bars and in every public place that makes stoners paranoid. I’m not even sure we were immune to the paranoia of being too high in public. No matter what, the alternative was worse. Smoking in Washington Square Park — fine, a little romantic
</p>

<p>
The girls: Whoever was interested in me, which happened to be a few girls but never the right ones. Alex and Charles poached a lot of wrong ones, too.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, a lot has changed. I have a job now, an apartment, a bike. I have a tiktok channel with 259 subscribers and 110k likes. I upload one tiktok every day. I will begin to upload Youtube videos daily. 
</p>

<p>
I am committed, above all else, to creating more. No one can stop me.

I’m not sure what the really young Seans dreamt of doing, but there is one specific path I’ve been faithful to:
</p>

<p>
I went to college in New York. I got a job waiting tables. I got an apartment. I sit writing
