  <h1>Central Park Manifesto</h1>

<p>As I wander further from home, I realize how necessary rules are. This summer, for the first time in my young life, I am only fighting myself. For a fair fight and the best chances of winning:</p>

<p>
1. <strong>Maintain a clean environment</strong><br>
There is no one coming to pick up after you. There is nothing romantic about sustained disorder. Do the dishes after you eat.
</p>

<p>
2. <strong>Consume mindfully</strong><br>
Books, movies, journalism, content, social media in that order. Watch videos for no more than an hour daily.
</p>

<p>
3. <strong>Relax aggressively</strong><br>
Alcohol and friends have their place. Together, they are the healthiest way to unwind. Solitude is deadly for extended periods of time.
</p>

<p>
4. <strong>No porn</strong><br>
Porn doubles the chance of divorce and makes sex worse. Thoughtful masturbation engages creativity. Horniness is power.
</p>

<p>
5. <strong>Pursue romance</strong><br>
Go to events, follow your heart.
</p>

<p>
6. <strong>Eat well</strong><br>
Fruits, vegetables, fiber, whole grains, protein, calcium. One or two meals a day. Coffee.
</p>

<p>
7. <strong>Follow ritual</strong><br>
Wake up, make bed, drink water, open window, brush teeth.
</p>

<p>
8. <strong>Engage the body</strong><br>
Swim, stretch, lift weights, and run. Read <em>Sun and Steel</em> by Mishima. Trigger primal arousal when naked.
</p>

<p>
9. <strong>Always be creating</strong><br>
Posters, essays, tiktoks, outfits, everything. Keep output high and attachment low. See what sticks in the world.
</p>

<p>
10. <strong>Remember what matters</strong><br>
Give cash to performers and cigarettes to bums. Compliment freely. Call your Grandma.
