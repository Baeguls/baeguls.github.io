  <h1>19 things I did before I turned 19</h1>
<p>
1. Met Mama and Dad in 2006. She’s a proud and rugged product of the ghetto,
flame-resistant maybe, a Chola, and the socialite switchboard operator at Santa Monica
College. He’s a soft-speaking blue-eyed ruminator, sensitive to violence and cuss words
and bad olive oil, and a retired English teacher writing code for the Air Force. They are
fire and ice and good parents.
</p>

<p>
2. Study hell for 11 years at Catholic School. An evil nun roams the halls, writing me
infractions for my various crimes (hair too long, not wearing a belt, running). I get
picked last for basketball. A teacher tells me to “hate the sin, not the sinner,” and the sin
is being gay. I don’t fit in. I learn that adults can be wrong about things. I start to resent
God because there ain’t no hate like Christian love.
</p>

<p>
3. Cruise west sitting shotgun with Dad, windows down, shirts off, enjoying jazz and the
gentle breeze. We are barefoot, wearing sunscreen and swim trunks; the floor of his old
Toyota is sandy and his seat-covers are towels. We play volleyball until noon, and then
he buys me a sandwich — squaw bread, avocado, vegetable sprouts, turkey, and
mustard, because this is Los Angeles. We wash it down with water from a fountain, then
go home to nap.
</p>

<p>
4. Declare independence from the Catholics; stop going to church, walk out of
confirmation classes, make Mom cry. My new public school is 10 times bigger than
before. I walk the halls alone on the first day, elated. It’s rougher around the edges — I
see fights, smoke rising from bathroom stalls, a boy holding a dead squirrel. But it’s also
more polished in the middle — there are clubs for me to join, nerds with self-imposed
bedtimes, and standards in place to stop teachers from using detention as the answer to
everything.
  </p>

<p>
5. Employ the scientific method. Observation: Life sucked, then I switched schools, and
now it sucks less. Question: Is there a place, lifestyle, group, niche, or groove where life
sucks the least? Hypothesis: Yes, there is, and I can find it by looking hard enough.
Experimentation: I will travel everywhere, eat anything, meet everyone — do
EVERYTHING at least once, even if it makes me uncomfortable, to learn about the
world and myself. Conclusion: My life’s mission is to become worldly, so I can decide
where the greenest grass is and settle down there. If I never find that place, at least I get
to die a man who’s seen it all.
</p>

<p>
6. Dream of New York City. Where else would a young American on a quest for
worldliness go? The city where diversity lives between blocks and buildings, with every
type of person contained within its borders, filled with jaded locals who have seen it all
and bright eyed newcomers who want to see more, seems to me like paradise.
</p>

<p>
7. Receive instructions from my favorite, weirdest English teacher — write what you
really care about. My topic is sex, because I’m 15 and this is public school and I can get
away with it. She loves the piece so much that she invites me to recite it at the school’s
art showcase. The night before I go on, the principal kicks me out of the program. I
never thanked her for saving my reputation. I start going to poetry readings.
</p>

<p>
8. Sleep with the same mistress that wasted 30 years of my Dad’s life. She demands so
much and pays so little. How do I find the discipline to sit quietly with my thoughts for
hours while working on a piece, then live so fully that I have thoughts worth writing
down? Where do I find the time to catch up on 500 years of literary canon when the first
interesting writer was born in 1922? Why does it have to be you, writing?
</p>

<p>
9. Show up for a job interview at a restaurant, get mistaken for a new hire, and start
serving drinks 5 minutes after walking through the door. I have long conversations with
regulars, practice Spanish in the kitchen, and eat Japanese food every day. I get the
restaurant on social media, ditch school to set up our new computer system, and hustle
old women for tips. I go from busboy to manager in a year.
</p>

<p>
10. Stand in the middle of the 91 early in the morning with my hood up, both hands in
my pockets. A police helicopter is circling overhead, shining a floodlight down on us. I
am somewhere near Compton, feeling slightly numb, watching a Challenger smear its
tires all over the interstate. After the driver finishes doing donuts, he will race off and we
will follow. This is a takeover, and I think it is helping me get something out of my
system.
</p>

<p>
11. Find a girl sitting alone in the back of an auditorium, somewhere far from home. She
is sensitive, sad, and very smart. Come to an agreement with her — she teaches me
about art and literature, I take her on a tour of the underworld. I am Jack from The
Titanic, showing my rich, snobby broad how to live from the passenger seat of my old
Honda Civic. I tell my friends that this is the one.
</p>

<p>
12. Decide that I’m not patient enough for love. Begin groveling for insecure girls; hop
through windows and break promises. Practice fake confidence — I know you want me
girl. Meet my divorced parents, physical intimacy and emotional intimacy. Guess who
has custody.
  </p>

<p>
13. Start sipping, swallowing, ripping (never dipping, minimal sniffing) on the weekend.
Drugs: why do them? No, don’t apologize for crying, and no I don’t mind that you’re
kissing me like that. Of course you can tell me something you’ve never told anyone
before. Beautiful stranger, I’ll hold it against the high. When the sun comes up and we
can see each other better, we’ll decide if that was really us last night.
</p>

<p>
14. Find Queen Broken. Cheated on her second boyfriend with her first one, then spent a
week fucking them both — at our school, giant label on her forehead that says TOXIC,
DO NOT TOUCH! Of course I want to touch. She won’t let me, tells me she really wants
to get to know me better. I say we have nothing in common. She says she has a hunch
about us. I say I don’t want anything serious right now. She says be mine. I ignore her,
ignore her, ignore her, but there she is.
</p>

<p>
15. Date Queen Broken. I get a surprise party, handwritten letters, rose petals on the
bed. I’m not there yet. I confront her about her past. Queen Broken cries — she’s fucked
up, but so am I, and she really wants us to be fucked up together. Love, she says, is not
about finding the “perfect” partner — it’s about finding the partner that cares about you
enough to try and become perfect. She tells me that we can grow together. Suddenly, I
understand something that I didn’t before.
</p>

<p>
16. Race my old Honda west towards the beach, windows down, shirt off, playing jazzy
rap on blown out speakers and driving barefoot on sandy astroturf matts. My lady has
her feet on the dashboard, so I brake too hard and she slaps me — we burst out
laughing. We meet our friends at noon; boys play volleyball, girls tan, we all swim. We
form a semi-circle when the sun paints the sky pink, sitting quietly, appreciating the
finer things in life, sipping cheap vodka straight out of our backpacks. We are young
Californians, beach-bums with bright futures, watching the sun set on our care-free
years.
</p>

<p>
17. Receive a cigarette from a bouncer. His hair is gray and his voice is gravely. “I want
to be a writer,” I tell him, and he peers down at me for a while like he knows me from
somewhere. “Spend more time alone,” he says, “and get to know yourself first, because
you are lost right now.” I don’t know what he means. I was alone before he started
talking to me. I go back inside the bar.
</p>

<p>
18. Graduate High School and become an adult. Touch down in Europe with no friends,
no plan, only a backpack and a deadline. Move in with Dutch art students, sit on their
rooftop and look up at the stars. I’ve met so many wonderful people and I still don’t feel
understood. Am I searching for something that was really inside me the whole time? I
think I should create more. I think I should love fewer people more deeply. I think I
should do less drugs.
</p>

<p>
19. Move to New York. My new private school is 30 times bigger than before. I am bright
eyed and ambitious, the happiest newcomer to ever strut down University Place. I have
so much left to do.
