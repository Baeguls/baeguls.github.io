  <h1>No Workers in the Workers' Party</h1>
  <p>On one particularly cold Sunday in Crown Heights, one
hundred of Brooklyn’s hippest have assembled together in a ken-
do club to discuss some of the most pressing matters of our time.
The crowd, seated between a powwow drum and a hand-paint-
ed banner that reads PEOPLE OVER PROFIT, skews young
and white. They stir when a young woman rises to address them:
“Comrades” — a pause — “we finally bought a podium!”

  Today’s points of discussion at the Party for Socialism and
Liberation include practical tips to prepare for deportation (buy a
storage unit) and the federally mandated shutdown of a gay social
club at Google. There is no doubt in my mind that many of my
fellow comrades arrived here today in Ubers. As one boy takes to
the stand, the PEOPLE OVER PROFIT sign falls to the ground
because it was hung with scotch tape. Is this the “radical left” that
keeps conservatives up at night?

  There is a single, hopeful moment: a young tech worker ad-
dresses the crowd, seeking advice from unionized workers. Team-
sters and District Council men snap to attention as he announces
his mission to wrestle some power away from his billionaire CEO.
He wants to start a union.

  The Party for Socialism and Liberation has passion (often
misdirected), aspiring politicians (kids with good hearts), and a
brand new podium. It may be the party for you.
