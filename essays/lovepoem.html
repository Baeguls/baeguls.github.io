  <h1>(After she blocked me)</h1>
<p>
Circling, circling, spinning the block<br>
Two bodies caught in gravity’s lock<br>
Wet sock arsonists under fogged-in ghettos<br>
Dreaming of lazy days in the celestial meadow<br>
Watching true love collapse into its final form:<br>
The neutron star or the black hole, they are reborn
