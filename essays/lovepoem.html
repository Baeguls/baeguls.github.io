  <h1>Bad poem for someone I love</h1>
<p>
Circling, circling, spinning the block<br>
Two bodies caught in gravity’s lock<br>
Wet sock arsonists under fogged-in ghettos<br>
Dreaming of lazy days in the celestial meadow<br>
Watching true love collapse into its final form:<br>
The neutron star or the black hole, they are reborn
</p>

<p>
First degree burns on my lips,<br>
Steaming manhole, our first kiss<br>
God willing I forgot how to speak,<br>
Already remembering the dry heat<br>
Full force frontal lobe assault,<br>
The fleeting high, the synchronized bliss<br>
No way to live, lost in all this
</p>
