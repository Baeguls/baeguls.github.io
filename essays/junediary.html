  <h1>Some Entries on Sobriety & Being 19 in NYC</h1>

On sobriety<br>
It’s my second day being sober from weed and alcohol. Its hard to gauge how much I was using before. I was high multiple times a week during the school year, especially around Alex, and I was drinking at least once or twice a week. I can probably count the time that I was drunk or high (often both) as “lost,” but there was also a much more insidious effect of perpetually being hungover that reached across my entire freshman year of college. I never had the energy to come to class on time, I never had a satisfactory amount of creative output, and I couldn't hold down a job. Maybe the whole year was lost. I am more powerful when I am sober?
Some things I am noticing with a sober, well-rested bran:
Mess bothers me more. Cleaning is more enticing. I want things to be in order so cooking feels more frictionless and the bugs stay away. I can also write without music. The boredom I expected to feel was replaced by purpose, hopefully eventually creativity.
Maybe you could turn this into a video. “Sober” from the frat boy drugs, lol. Bit dramatic. Maybe include your screen time. “App block” has a good tracker for this.
On the struggles of early adulthood<br>
It’s so hard to cook every day! I buy too many groceries, I buy groceries I don't want to eat, I don't do my dishes, I generate too many dishes, I need to build a whole spice rack from scratch, I need to build a whole pantry from scratch.

I feel amazing. I’m reducing my screen time, cleaning my apartment, listening to new audiobooks. Not much creative output, but I feel like I’m on the verge of some great things. I have ideas and the will to create them. I’m thinking so clearly. I can’t wait for all my friends to come back to NYC. I have a feeling I am going to be surrounded by cool people. Amandine, Charles, Davids, Jacquie, Columbia people, Stern people, Tisch people. I’ll have disposable income to appreciate a mostly sober life and I’ll build an amazing wardrobe. This is going to be the best year of my life. I’m going to make so many friends and have a great network. When I renegotiate this sobriety contract and resume drinking and smoking, I will do it in moderation. Charles is a perfect role model. Drinking once every two weeks, smoking once every two months. The best part: I have the whole summer, isolated, to work my way up to server and prove myself creatively. The calm before the storm. I’m so glad I stayed in NYC. 
I have feelings of resentment toward my old friends that I can’t explain. I wish I could show them this life I’m building. I wish they could see that I am the role model. Cutting back on my vices, embracing my weird authentic self, taking a risk and moving to a new city, looking to explore the world and carve out my freedom as soon as possible. I fear what they’ll say when I ascend. He’s a fake friend. He thinks he’s better than us. He didn’t want to talk to us. I will be like a wind chime tossed around in a storm, singing because I can’t help it. I am tremendously lucky. For now, I am different from them, only because of the weather here.

Day 4 being sober. I have work in an hour. Recalibrating my brain is proving to be more difficult than I thought. I’m playing wack-a-mole with my vices… maybe I can stay sober and keep off my phone, but then I eat more than I should and scroll through old messages with past flings. Hopefully there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Is it possible to get into a groove where I truly spend all of my time between work, a book, sleep, walks, and conversation?

I am anxious that AI will produce a tsunami of change and I haven't reached higher ground yet. It’s not even a wave I can surf, it’s just this raw destructive force brewing. Everyone is watching the water recede with no understanding of the disaster that follows. I want to get a foothold in the door, a successful project, something that proves I am more than just an English major from NYU and a waiter in a restaurant. For this reason, I am going to produce an AI-generated tiktok account using Veo 3 and another entirely human-made YouTube video. I think my first video on tiktok should be a human rant about AI, and everything that follows will be an AI video. I am going to spend the next few days writing a dozen or so AI videos, and once I get my paycheck on Monday and can buy Veo 3 I will make them all in a caffeine flurry. 
Work just finished and I got high with gay bushwick Alex Harr. Nice!

Friday. I fell off a little. Maybe work did it. Got high again, watched porn, let my room get filthier. I’m a little angry at myself, but its fine. I just keep getting better.
I’m interested in spiritual fasting
No alcohol, weed, or masturbation for the summer and minimal tiktok rotting. We’re channeling monk energy, letting desire bubble up until it pours over into my art. This time is different because I am building the muscles of discipline, not trying to shoot for the stars, just setting ground rules that will be unequivocal net positives in my life.

I am grateful to be alive. <br>
I am grateful for Elisabeth. <br>
I am grateful for New York City. <br>
I am grateful for my apartment. <br>
I am grateful for my job that bought me more time <br>
I am grateful for my body <br>
I am grateful for my parents <br>
I am grateful for my new life. <br>
I am grateful for college. <br>
Today, I go thrifting, walk in the sun for a while, and then make my way to the NYU library for a marathon AI session. I come back, cook, unwind, read for a bit, then resume my session. Afterwards I call elisabeth.

On Living in NYC <BR>
I think New York is the greatest city on earth because it is the most involved city on Earth. Living here is like having a really hot, really high maintenance girlfriend. Shes wants all your money and she’s going to make you wait 2 hours for her to get ready, but when you get to make love to her, oh my god— you know what they say about New York nines? In the suburbs, where I grew up, everything is frictionless. You can drive to Costco, you don’t have to talk to anyone all day, you always have air conditioning, and here, it smells like piss. But EVERY SO OFTEN, you can really make love to this place. Like, LORDE WILL JUST RANDOMLY SHOW UP IN THE PARK AND PERFORM. 
<br>
That’s New York, man. It won't happen anywhere else.
