  <h1>Some Entries on Being 19 in NYC</h1>


<p>
June 4 <br>
Day 4 being sober. I have work in an hour. Recalibrating my brain is proving to be more difficult than I thought. I’m playing wack-a-mole with my vices… maybe I can stay sober and keep off my phone, but then I eat more than I should and scroll through old messages with past flings. Hopefully there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Is it possible to get into a groove where I truly spend all of my time between work, a book, sleep, walks, and conversation?

I am anxious that AI will produce a tsunami of change and I haven't reached higher ground yet. It’s not even a wave I can surf, it’s just this raw destructive force brewing. Everyone is watching the water recede with no understanding of the disaster that follows. I want to get a foothold in the door, a successful project, something that proves I am more than just an English major from NYU and a waiter in a restaurant. For this reason, I am going to produce an AI-generated tiktok account using Veo 3 and another entirely human-made YouTube video. I think my first video on tiktok should be a human rant about AI, and everything that follows will be an AI video. I am going to spend the next few days writing a dozen or so AI videos, and once I get my paycheck on Monday and can buy Veo 3 I will make them all in a caffeine flurry. 
Work just finished and I got high with gay bushwick Alex Harr. Nice!

I am grateful to be alive. <br>
I am grateful for Elisabeth. <br>
I am grateful for New York City. <br>
I am grateful for my apartment. <br>
I am grateful for my job that bought me more time <br>
I am grateful for my body <br>
I am grateful for my parents <br>
I am grateful for my new life. <br>
I am grateful for college. <br>
Today, I go thrifting, walk in the sun for a while, and then make my way to the NYU library for a marathon AI session. I come back, cook, unwind, read for a bit, then resume my session. Afterwards I call elisabeth.

On Living in NYC <BR>
I think New York is the greatest city on earth because it is the most involved city on Earth. Living here is like having a really hot, really high maintenance girlfriend. Shes wants all your money and she’s going to make you wait 2 hours for her to get ready, but when you get to make love to her, oh my god— you know what they say about New York nines? In the suburbs, where I grew up, everything is frictionless. You can drive to Costco, you don’t have to talk to anyone all day, you always have air conditioning, and here, it smells like piss. But EVERY SO OFTEN, you can really make love to this place. Like, LORDE WILL JUST RANDOMLY SHOW UP IN THE PARK AND PERFORM. 
<br>
That’s New York, man. It won't happen anywhere else.
